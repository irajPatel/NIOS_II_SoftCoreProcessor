CORES Softcore Processor
Description
CORES is a softcore processor developed using the Quartus Prime Platform Designer (formerly known as Qsys). This softcore processor is designed to provide a customizable and configurable processing unit that can be integrated into FPGA-based designs. The processor includes various components such as PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) and ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter), allowing it to perform specific tasks based on the application requirements.

Components
1. PLL (Phase-Locked Loop)
The PLL component in CORES is used for clock synchronization and frequency multiplication. It helps generate stable clock signals for different modules within the processor, ensuring proper timing and synchronization of operations.

2. ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
The ADC component is responsible for converting analog signals to digital data. This is particularly useful when interfacing with external analog sensors or inputs. The ADC in CORES enables the processor to process real-world analog data within FPGA designs.

Integration and Connections
CORES is designed to be easily integrated into FPGA projects using the Quartus Prime Platform Designer. To use CORES in your project, follow these steps:

Open Quartus Prime Platform Designer.
Import the CORES processor IP.
Configure the processor parameters based on your project requirements.
Connect the processor to other modules in your design (e.g., memory, peripherals) using the Platform Designer GUI.

# CORES Softcore Processor Repository

Welcome to the CORES Softcore Processor repository! This repository showcases the development and integration of a powerful softcore processor into FPGA-based designs using Quartus Prime Lite (version 18.1) and Platform Designer (formerly known as Qsys).

## Project Highlights

The CORES softcore processor is designed to offer a flexible and configurable processing unit, enabling seamless integration into FPGA projects. This repository includes:

- **Customizable Components:** Explore the integration of key components such as PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) for clock management, ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) for handling analog data, on-chip memory (RAM and flash) for data storage, and clock crossing bridges for managing clock signals effectively.

- **Step-by-Step Integration:** Follow detailed step-by-step instructions to integrate the CORES softcore processor into your FPGA designs. We provide clear guidance on setting up a new project, configuring components, establishing connections, and generating the required HDL (Verilog) code.

- **Video Tutorial:** Access a comprehensive video tutorial that accompanies this repository. The tutorial walks you through the entire integration process, making it easier to understand and implement the CORES softcore processor in your FPGA projects.

- **Advanced FPGA Design Concepts:** As a bonus, we recommend an advanced FPGA design course that covers a wide range of topics, including softcore processors, FPGA cloud resources, and practical exercises to enhance your FPGA design skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CORES softcore processor project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Repository:** Download the entire repository (ZIP format) to your local computer.

2. **Open Quartus Prime:** Launch Quartus Prime Lite (version 18.1) on your computer.

3. **Open the Project:** Navigate to the downloaded folder and locate the 'NIOS_5' folder. Inside this folder, you'll find the 'cores.qsys' file. Double-click on this file to open it in Platform Designer.

4. **Edit the Softcore Processor:** Use Platform Designer to customize and configure the CORES softcore processor according to your project requirements. Make changes to the components, connections, clock settings, memory, and more.

5. **Run on DE10 Lite FPGA Board:** To run your customized CORES softcore processor on the DE10 Lite FPGA board, follow these steps:
   - Connect the DE10 Lite FPGA board to your computer.
   - Compile the project in Quartus Prime.
   - Program the FPGA with the compiled bitstream file.
   - Observe the behavior of the softcore processor on the DE10 Lite board and test its functionality.
